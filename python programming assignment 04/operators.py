#Python Assignment Operators

    # x = 5	    x = 5
	# x += 3	x = x + 3	#8
	# x -= 3	x = x - 3	#2
	# x *= 3	x = x * 3	#15

#Python Comparison Operators

# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	

#Python Logical Operators

# 	and	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and x < 10	
# 	or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# 	not	Reverse the result, returns False if the resul...	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

#Python Identity Operators

# is	Returns True if both variables are the same ob...	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same	x is not y


#Python Membership Operators
